Node.js Event Loop
Node.js is built on an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which relies heavily on its event loop to manage asynchronous operations. Understanding the event loop is crucial for writing efficient and responsive Node.js applications.

How the Event Loop Works
At the core of every Node.js application is its event loop. The event loop is responsible for managing the execution of code in a non-blocking manner. It allows Node.js to handle multiple requests and tasks concurrently without blocking the entire application when one operation takes a long time to complete.

The Node.js event loop works by constantly checking the event queue for pending events or tasks. When an event is ready to be processed, it's taken from the queue and executed. Events in this context can be I/O operations, timers, callbacks, or other asynchronous operations.
